# Introduction
Neural networks are computational systems inspired by the structure and functioning of the
human brain. These networks consist of processing units called neurons, which are
connected in layers. Each neuron receives inputs, applies an activation function, and
produces an output that is transmitted to other neurons. Neural networks use learning
algorithms such as backpropagation to adjust the weights between neurons and improve
their performance based on data. These networks are capable of simulating complex
patterns and are used in various tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision,
pattern recognition, and analyzing complex datasets. Since neural networks can respond to
data and improve themselves, they can make intelligent predictions and decisions without
requiring precise programming. For this reason, neural networks have become one of the
main tools in artificial intelligence and machine learning research.
